## Why I want to learn coding

There are plenty of reasons to want to learn coding, regardless of what I do with my life. Some of them are:
* I'll be better equipped to do my current job and coach our students.
* I'll have more options for staying in the tech industry, even if I move on from Epicodus.
* I'll be able to bring my app ideas to life without hiring help.
* Maybe I'll finally finish my goddamned website [which is here!](http://rachelbussert.com) (and expired to boot)
* It's fun!
